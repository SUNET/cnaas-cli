# Changelog

## 2020-04-25

- Now possible to execute 'show' and 'no' command with out the id attribute. For example, instead of doing 'show device id 123' one can now do 'show device 123' and 'no device id 123' can be replaced with 'no device 123'.

## 2020-04-24

- If 'show job', 'show job id 0', 'show job id -1' or 'show job id last' is executed we will get the last job and show the result of it.

- Only show the command arguments that are valid for each operation. For example: If we do 'show device <tab><tab>' the tab-completion will only display the argument 'id' since that one is the only one needed when showing a single device.

### Added

- Monitor mode. When displaying a job with 'show job id 123' one can now add '| monitor' to refresh the job status until the job finishes or Ctrl+C is invoked.

- Auto-expansion of parameters. It is now possible to define parameters as default in the YAML specification. For example, the 'sync' command can have 'dry_run' set to True by default. This will let the user type in 'sync device hostname test' and it will expand to 'sync device hostname test dry_run true' if the dry_run parameter is not added.

- More detailed device output. If a single device is listed with 'show device id 123' all details about the device will now be displayed.

- More detailed job output. Just like devices, if a single job is displayed with 'show job id 123' all job details including exceptions etc will be shown.

- Better tab completion. Command and attribute descriptions will be disp√∂ayed in a better way when tab completion is used.

- 'exit' to leave the CLI. Now possible to use both 'quit' and 'exit' to leave the CLI.

- A new command, 'update', is introduced. This can be used to update values of already existing devices. For example, to change state of a device, 'update device id 123 state MANAGED' can be used.

- Handle the rare case where a command should send a PUT towards the API instead of a POST.

- For the contexts no, show and update only display the commands available for each context when using tab-complete. For example, we can't update a group so don't display it when doing update.
